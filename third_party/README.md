The files in this directory are a combination of Nutso and a subset of the Noto Serif fonts, provided as a _proof of concept_ working example.
The version of Noto Serif used is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, so those example fonts are also licensed the same way. 
They are kept in a separate directory to clarify this different licensing status, along with a copy of the Apache license itself.
